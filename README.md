# Caesar Cipher
## Python Application 

### Description

This application was made to use the [Caesar Cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher) rules to encrypt/decrypt a string.

Caesar Cipher is used to shift a string such as "cat" by a key such as "c". 

Each letter of the alphabet defines how much the string should be shifted by, starting at A = 0 through to Z = 25. 

### Encryption Examples

Shifting the string "cat" by the key "c" which equals to 2 would shift the string to "ecv". 

What happens is it goes through the alphabet and finds the position of each letter in the string, so it would find "c" and change it by 2 characters which would make it "e".

### Decryption Examples

The same can be shown for Decryption. It will shift the string "ecv" by the key "c" which will change the String back to "cat".
